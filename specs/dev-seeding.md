# Dev Seeding

Local fixture seeding is command-driven by default:

- CLI seeding (`bun run seed:dev`) populates shared catalog fixtures under `@local`, including
  skill, plugin, scanner, and moderation fixtures. This is the documented local setup path.
- `internal.devSeed.seedCurrentUserFixtures` remains a dev-only internal action for explicit local
  development tools/tests that need fixtures cloned to a local user.

Current-user fixture seeding must not be exposed as a public Convex `api` function or browser UI
action. Internal tooling may pass an `ownerUserId`, but that id must stay inside trusted local seed
tooling rather than crossing a frontend boundary. Fixture slugs and package names must include a
stable per-user seed key so multiple developers can use the same dev deployment without colliding.

Current-user fixture seeding is dev-only. It must reject production Convex deployments, and it
should not be exposed as a first-run dashboard button unless the UX and ownership rules are
intentionally revisited.
